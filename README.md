#Observations

#The following inferences can be made from the describe() method:

 #   The .csv file has data of IPL matches starting from the season 2008 to 2019.
  #  The biggest margin of victory for the team batting first(win_by_runs) is 146 runs.
  # # The biggest victory of the team batting second(win_by_wickets) is by 10 wickets.
  # # 75% of the victorious teams that bat first won by a margin of 19 runs.
   # 75% of the victorious teams that bat second won by a margin of 6 wickets.
   # There were 756 IPL matches hosted from 2008 to 2019.

# Let's view the unique values of each column to help us understand the dataset better.

ipl_matches_df.isnull().sum()
#The column 'umpire3' has a significant number of NaN values. As the off-field umpire parameter is insignificant, we can drop this column. The other columns that have Nan values are of type object(Pandas equivalent of Python String data type) and are very few in number(<=7).

#Q1:Does the presence of most valuable players in a team ensures IPL trophy?
#Q1:Does the presence of most valuable players in a team ensures IPL trophy?

#We have figured out the top ten players of IPL using 'Player of the Match' title as the yardstick. It is interesting to note that the top two players - Chris Gayle and AB de Villers have never won an IPL. Of the top ten players, 6 players(RG Sharma, MS Dhoni, DA Warner, SR Watson, SK Raina and G Gambhir) have won the IPL. It exemplifies the importance of the presence of most valuable player(s) in a team.
